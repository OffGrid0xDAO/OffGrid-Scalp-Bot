# Trading Bot System Architecture - Strategic Planning Questions

## Overview of Your Vision

Based on the old implementation (main.py), I understand you want to build:

```
1. Data Pipeline → Gather 1 year of historical data (6 timeframes) from Hyperliquid API
2. Indicator Calculation → Apply EMA ribbons + RSI + MACD + VWAP + Volume
3. Optimal Trade Detection → Find theoretical maximum profit trades in historical data
4. Strategy/Model Development → Build rule-based or ML model to predict trades
5. Backtesting → Test strategy on historical data
6. Comparison System → Compare: Optimal Trades vs Backtest vs Live Trades
7. Continuous Optimization → Bot learns and adapts parameters automatically
8. Live Trading → Execute real trades with auto-improvement
```

**Key Innovation from old system**:
- Rule-based trading (99% cost savings, no API calls per trade)
- Auto-optimization every 30 minutes using Claude to analyze patterns
- Self-improving system that gets smarter over time

## CRITICAL STRATEGIC QUESTIONS

### 1. OPTIMAL TRADES DETECTION - Ground Truth Definition

**Question 1A**: How should we define "optimal trades" in the historical data?

Your old system used `SmartTradeFinder` which appears to:
- Look for best entry/exit points in hindsight
- Maximize profit per trade
- Consider EMA ribbon states

**Options**:
- **A) Perfect hindsight**: Buy exact bottom, sell exact top (unrealistic but shows theoretical max)
- **B) Realistic constraints**: Entry must match indicator signals (EMA alignment, RSI, etc.), exits based on realistic rules (profit target hit, stop loss, time limit)
- **C) Hybrid**: Find best trades that COULD have been caught with our indicators

Which approach do you prefer? Should optimal trades be:
- Pure maximum profit (A)?
- Constrained by realistic entry signals (B)?
- Something in between (C)?

**Question 1B**: What timeframe should we use for optimal trade detection?

Your old system seems to focus on 5min data. Should we:
- **A) Detect optimal trades per timeframe** (1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h separately)?
- **B) Use multi-timeframe confirmation** (like old dual_timeframe_bot: 1m+3m or 5m+15m)?
- **C) Detect on fast timeframe, validate on slow** (find on 1m, confirm on 5m/15m)?

**Question 1C**: What are the optimal trade criteria?

Should an optimal trade REQUIRE:
- Minimum profit target? (e.g., must make at least 0.3% profit)
- Maximum hold time? (e.g., 1-15 minutes for scalping)
- Minimum risk/reward ratio? (e.g., 2:1 or better)
- Specific indicator alignment? (ribbon must be aligned, RSI in zone, etc.)

---

### 2. STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT - Rule-Based vs ML

**Question 2A**: What prediction approach do you want?

Your old system was **rule-based** (trading_rules.json with thresholds). This is:
- ✅ Fast, no API calls, cheap
- ✅ Interpretable (you understand why it trades)
- ❌ Requires manual rule tuning
- ✅ Auto-optimization via Claude works well

**Options for new system**:
- **A) Pure rule-based** (like old system):
  - Define entry/exit rules
  - Parameters like: ribbon_alignment_threshold, min_light_emas_required, etc.
  - Claude optimizes parameters every 30 min
  - Simple, proven, cost-effective

- **B) Machine Learning model**:
  - Train classifier: LONG/SHORT/WAIT based on indicators
  - Features: All 28 EMAs, RSI, MACD, VWAP, Volume
  - Target: Optimal trades as labels
  - Model predicts probability of profitable trade
  - More complex, needs retraining

- **C) Hybrid**:
  - ML model generates confidence score
  - Rule-based system validates (filter out low-quality signals)
  - Best of both worlds but more complex

**Which approach do you want?** I recommend starting with **A) Rule-based** since your old system proved this works and is 99% cheaper.

**Question 2B**: If rule-based, what rules matter most?

From your old system, you had patterns like:
- **Path E**: Dark transition (all EMAs flip color quickly)
- **Path D**: Early reversal (light EMAs change before dark)
- **Path C**: Wick reversal (price rejects and bounces)
- **Path A**: Trending (strong directional move)
- **Path B**: Breakout (consolidation then burst)

Should we:
- **A) Keep similar pattern-based approach** (classify candle patterns, score them)?
- **B) Focus on indicator confluence** (RSI + MACD + VWAP + EMAs all agree)?
- **C) Simpler rules** (just ribbon state + 1-2 indicators)?

**Question 2C**: What indicators are MOST important for your strategy?

Rank these in priority order (1 = most important, 7 = least):
- ___ EMA Ribbon (28 lines, colors, compression, slope)
- ___ RSI (overbought/oversold momentum)
- ___ MACD (trend direction and strength)
- ___ VWAP (institutional support/resistance)
- ___ Volume (confirmation of moves)
- ___ EMA Crossovers (golden/death crosses)
- ___ Price Action (candle patterns, wicks, ranges)

This will help me prioritize what to calculate and test first.

### 3. BACKTESTING FRAMEWORK

**Question 3A**: How should backtesting work?

**Options**:
- **A) Walk-forward testing** (train on period 1, test on period 2, train on 1+2, test on 3, etc.)
  - Prevents overfitting
  - Simulates real-world performance
  - More realistic but slower

- **B) Full historical backtest** (test strategy on entire 1 year at once)
  - Faster to run
  - Shows overall performance
  - Risk of overfitting to past data

- **C) Monte Carlo simulation** (randomize entry times, test thousands of scenarios)
  - Statistical robustness
  - Confidence intervals
  - Very slow

**Which do you prefer?** I recommend **A) Walk-forward** for realistic results.

**Question 3B**: What metrics matter for evaluating strategy performance?

Your old system tracked:
- Win rate
- Total PnL
- Winning/losing trades

**Should we also track**:
- Profit factor (gross profit / gross loss)?
- Maximum drawdown (worst losing streak)?
- Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted returns)?
- Average hold time?
- Trades per day/hour?
- Win rate by timeframe?
- Win rate by pattern type?

**Question 3C**: What is your SUCCESS threshold?

When comparing backtest to optimal trades, what's acceptable?
- Capture rate: What % of optimal trades should the strategy catch? (50%? 70%? 90%?)
- Profit efficiency: Strategy PnL should be what % of optimal PnL? (40%? 60%? 80%?)
- Win rate: Minimum acceptable? (60%? 70%?)

This helps set goals for optimization.

### 4. COMPARISON SYSTEM - The 3-Way Analysis

You want to compare:
```
OPTIMAL TRADES (theoretical max)
    ↓
BACKTEST TRADES (strategy on historical data)
    ↓
LIVE TRADES (actual bot execution)
```

**Question 4A**: What should the comparison reveal?

Should the analysis show:
- **A) Gap analysis**: Which optimal trades were missed and why?
- **B) False positives**: Which backtest trades were losers (shouldn't have entered)?
- **C) Execution quality**: Did live trades match backtest performance?
- **D) Pattern insights**: Which patterns/setups work best?
- **E) All of the above**?

**Question 4B**: How should results be presented?

**Options**:
- **A) Dashboard/charts** (visual comparison of equity curves)
- **B) Detailed reports** (markdown/text analysis like old system)
- **C) Telegram notifications** (summary stats sent to you)
- **D) Interactive HTML** (click through trades, see charts)
- **E) All of the above**?

**Question 4C**: Real-time vs batch analysis?

- **A) Real-time**: After each live trade, instantly compare to optimal/backtest
- **B) Periodic**: Every hour, analyze last N trades
- **C) Daily summary**: End of day report
- **D) On-demand**: You request analysis via command

---

### 5. CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION - The Learning Loop

Your old system optimized every 30 minutes using Claude API. This was brilliant for cost savings!

**Question 5A**: What should the optimizer analyze?

When Claude reviews performance every 30 min, should it:
- **A) Analyze recent trades** (last 30 min of decisions)?
- **B) Analyze vs optimal trades** (what did we miss)?
- **C) Adjust rule parameters** (tighten/loosen thresholds)?
- **D) Identify new patterns** (discover new setups)?
- **E) All of the above in priority order**?

**Question 5B**: How aggressive should optimization be?

**Conservative approach**:
- Small parameter adjustments (±5-10%)
- Only change 1-2 parameters per cycle
- Gradual improvement, lower risk

**Aggressive approach**:
- Large parameter swings (±20-50%)
- Change many parameters at once
- Faster learning, higher risk of instability

**Which do you prefer?**

**Question 5C**: Should there be human approval?

**Options**:
- **A) Fully automated**: Bot applies Claude's recommendations immediately (like old system)
- **B) Approval required**: Claude suggests, you approve via Telegram before applying
- **C) Hybrid**: Auto-apply small changes, require approval for large changes

### 6. DATA ARCHITECTURE

**Question 6A**: How should we store data long-term?

Current plan: CSV files (~600MB for 1 year)

**Options**:
- **A) CSV files** (simple, portable, easy to read)
- **B) SQLite database** (faster queries, smaller files, better for time-range queries)
- **C) Parquet files** (compressed, very fast with pandas, 80% smaller than CSV)
- **D) Hybrid**: Raw data in Parquet, processed indicators in SQLite

**Which do you prefer?** I recommend **D) Hybrid** for best performance.

**Question 6B**: Should we fetch data once or continuously update?

**Options**:
- **A) Fetch 1 year once**, then manually update when needed
- **B) Auto-update daily** (fetch last 24h every day, append to historical data)
- **C) Real-time updates** (fetch new candles every 1-5 minutes during live trading)

**Question 6C**: How should we handle multiple symbols?

Currently focused on ETH. Should architecture support:
- **A) ETH only** (keep it simple)
- **B) Multiple coins** (ETH, BTC, SOL, etc.) with same strategy
- **C) Symbol-specific strategies** (different rules per coin)

---

### 7. LIVE TRADING EXECUTION

**Question 7A**: What's the execution priority?

Your old system could trade on:
- 1min + 3min (scalping, fast)
- 5min + 15min (day trading, slower)

**Should new system**:
- **A) Focus on one pair** (e.g., 1m+3m for scalping)?
- **B) Support multiple strategies** (run 1m+3m AND 5m+15m simultaneously)?
- **C) Dynamic timeframe selection** (bot chooses based on market conditions)?

**Question 7B**: Position management - multiple simultaneous trades?

**Options**:
- **A) One trade at a time** (simple, clear, like old system)
- **B) Multiple trades per timeframe** (can have 2-3 positions open)
- **C) Grid/ladder approach** (multiple entries at different levels)

**Question 7C**: What happens when backtest diverges from live results?

If backtest shows 70% win rate but live trades only 50%:
- **A) Pause live trading** (wait for investigation)
- **B) Reduce position size** (trade smaller until performance recovers)
- **C) Switch to paper trading** (test fixes without risk)
- **D) Alert human** (send Telegram notification, you decide)

### 8. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES

**Question 8A**: What should we build FIRST?

**Option A - Data-first approach**:
```
Week 1: Fetch all 1-year data (6 timeframes)
Week 2: Calculate all indicators (EMAs, RSI, MACD, VWAP)
Week 3: Build optimal trade detector
Week 4: Build strategy & backtest
Week 5: Build comparison system
Week 6: Integrate live trading
```

**Option B - MVP approach** (get something working fast):
```
Week 1: Fetch 1-2 timeframes only (1m, 5m)
Week 2: Basic indicators (EMAs + 1 other)
Week 3: Simple rule-based strategy
Week 4: Basic backtest + live trading
Week 5: Add more indicators & optimize

```

**Which approach?** Option B gets you trading faster, Option A is more complete.

**Question 8B**: Testing strategy - paper trade first?

Before risking real money:
- **A) Paper trade for X days** (how many days? 7? 30?)
- **B) Backtest is enough**, go straight to testnet
- **C) Small live test** (trade with $10-50 to verify execution)

**Question 8C**: Should we replicate old bot's features or redesign?

Your old system had:
- Dual timeframe confirmation
- Pattern-based entry (5 paths: A, B, C, D, E)
- Rule-based with auto-optimization
- Telegram integration
- Claude-powered insights every 30 min

**Should we**:
- **A) Port the old logic** to new clean codebase (faster, proven)
- **B) Redesign from scratch** using new insights (better but slower)
- **C) Hybrid**: Keep proven patterns, add new indicators/features

- **B) Summary only** (hourly/daily stats)
- **C) Exceptions only** (losses, missed opportunities)
- **D) Configurable** (you set notification level)

---

### 10. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Question 10A**: What safety limits should be hardcoded?

**Suggestions**:
- Max position size: X% of account
- Max daily loss: Stop trading if down X%
- Max drawdown: Pause if down X% from peak
- Max trades per hour: Prevent runaway bot
- Circuit breaker: If 5 losses in a row, pause

**What limits do you want?**

**Question 10B**: How should the bot handle API failures?

If Hyperliquid API goes down during live trade:
- **A) Close position immediately** (at market)
- **B) Keep position, retry** (use last known data)
- **C) Alert human, wait for decision**

**Question 10C**: Emergency stop mechanism?

**Options**:
- **A) Telegram command** (`/emergency_stop`)
- **B) File-based killswitch** (create `STOP.txt` file)
- **C) Position monitor** (separate script watches account, can force close)
- **D) All of the above**
