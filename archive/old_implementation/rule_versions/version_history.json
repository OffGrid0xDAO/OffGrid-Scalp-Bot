      "reasoning": "The data reveals a dual crisis requiring both emergency technical fixes and radical strategy overhaul. With 0 actual trades vs 1078 backtest trades, the execution system is completely broken and must be fixed first. The strategy problem is equally severe: taking 11,977% more trades than optimal while losing money proves our filters are fundamentally wrong. Since optimal achieved +6.23% from just 9 trades (+0.69% average), we need to identify and replicate their specific patterns while eliminating the noise causing 1000+ bad trades. The solution is a barbell approach: ultra-selective base rules (45+ light EMAs, 0.006% spread, 90min stale threshold) to reduce trades by 95%+, combined with momentum surge overrides for exceptional opportunities. Higher profit targets (3.0-3.5%) and longer holds (90+ min) match optimal trade characteristics. The new path_f_momentum_surge with complete filter overrides ensures we don't miss big movements due to overly restrictive rules. This creates a system that waits patiently for high-probability setups while aggressively capturing momentum when it appears."
