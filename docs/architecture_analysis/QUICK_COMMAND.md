## Full Analysis Command

```
Please perform a comprehensive DSP architecture analysis on my TradingScalper codebase using the framework in docs/architecture_analysis/DSP_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md.

Analyze the following components systematically:

1. REAL-TIME DATA ENGINE
   - WebSocket streaming infrastructure
   - Multi-timeframe candle aggregation
   - Data validation and gap handling
   - Efficient circular buffers

2. ADAPTIVE DSP PROCESSOR
   - Parallel multi-timeframe processing
   - Online Kalman filter updates
   - Streaming wavelet decomposition
   - Dynamic parameter adjustment
   - Constructive interference calculation

3. SIGNAL FUSION ENGINE
   - Weight calculation based on timeframe coherence
   - Confidence scoring with uncertainty quantification
   - Multi-signal aggregation logic
   - Entry/exit trigger generation

For each component:
‚úÖ Determine status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED / PARTIAL / MISSING
‚úÖ Identify file paths and line numbers
‚úÖ Assess if processing is STREAMING or BATCH
‚úÖ List specific gaps and issues
‚úÖ Provide actionable recommendations

Focus especially on detecting these RED FLAGS:
‚ùå Batch reprocessing (Kalman/wavelet on full history)
‚ùå REST API polling instead of WebSocket
‚ùå No multi-timeframe analysis
‚ùå Fixed parameters (no adaptation)
‚ùå No confidence scoring
‚ùå Sequential processing (no parallelization)
‚ùå Unbounded memory growth

Provide:
1. Executive summary with completion %
2. Component-by-component detailed analysis
3. Critical issues list (prioritized)
4. Implementation roadmap with time estimates
5. Code examples showing current state and recommendations

Be thorough, specific, and include file:line references for all findings.
```

## Quick Critical-Issues-Only Command

If you just want to know what's broken:

```
Analyze my TradingScalper codebase for critical architectural issues based on real-time DSP trading system requirements.

Focus only on:
‚ùå RED FLAGS: Batch processing, REST polling, no streaming, single timeframe
‚ùå CRITICAL GAPS: Missing components that prevent real-time operation
‚ùå TOP 5 PRIORITIES: Most impactful improvements with effort estimates

Be brief but specific with file paths and line numbers.
```

---

## Targeted Component Analysis

To analyze just one component:

```
Analyze the [COMPONENT NAME] in my TradingScalper codebase:

[Replace COMPONENT NAME with one of:]
- Real-Time Data Engine
- Adaptive DSP Processor
- Signal Fusion Engine

Determine:
1. What exists vs what's missing
2. Is it streaming or batch?
3. File paths and line numbers
4. Top 3 improvements needed

Be specific and include code examples.
```

---

## Verification Command (After Making Changes)

After implementing improvements:

```
I've implemented [DESCRIBE CHANGES] in [FILE PATHS].

Please verify:
1. Does this now match the DSP architecture requirements?
2. Is it properly streaming/online (not batch)?
3. Are there any remaining issues?
4. What should I test to validate correctness?

Reference the requirements in docs/architecture_analysis/DSP_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md
```

---

## Progress Check Command

To see how much you've completed:

```
Based on the DSP architecture requirements in docs/architecture_analysis/DSP_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md:

1. What % of the target architecture is currently implemented?
2. Which components are complete vs partial vs missing?
3. What are the next 3 most important improvements?
4. How much total effort (hours/days) to reach production-ready?

Provide a concise progress report.
```

## Copy-Paste Ready Commands

**For First-Time Analysis:**
```
Read docs/architecture_analysis/DSP_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md and perform the complete analysis on my TradingScalper codebase. Generate the full report as specified in the document.
```

**For Quick Assessment:**
```
Quick assessment: Does my TradingScalper codebase use streaming DSP or batch processing? List top 3 critical issues.
```

**For Specific Component:**
```
Analyze only the Kalman filter implementation. Is it streaming or batch? Show code examples and how to fix if needed.
```

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Point Claude to specific files if you know where to look
   ```
   Focus your analysis on these files:
   - data_fetcher.py
   - signal_generator.py
   - kalman_filter.py
   ```

2. **Ask for Code Examples**: Always request before/after code
   ```
   For each issue found, show:
   1. Current code (with file:line)
   2. Recommended fix (with code example)
   ```

3. **Request Priorities**: Get actionable next steps
   ```
   Rank all improvements by:
   - Critical (system won't work)
   - High (major performance/correctness impact)
   - Medium (nice to have)
   - Low (polish)
   ```

4. **Iterative Analysis**: Start broad, then drill down
   ```
   First pass: Executive summary only
   Second pass: Deep dive on critical issues
   Third pass: Detailed recommendations for each component
   ```

## Example Workflow

### Session 1: Discovery
```
1. "Read DSP_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md and give me an executive summary
    of what needs to be analyzed"

2. "Now run the full analysis focusing on critical issues first"

3. "For the top 3 critical issues, show me exactly what code needs to change"
```

### Session 2: Implementation
```
1. "I'm going to fix [ISSUE]. Guide me step-by-step with code examples"

2. [After implementing] "Review my changes in [FILE]. Did I implement it correctly?"

3. "What should I test to verify this fix works properly?"
```

### Session 3: Validation
```
1. "Re-run the analysis on [COMPONENT]. Is it now compliant?"

2. "What's my new completion percentage?"

3. "What should I work on next?"
```

## Common Follow-Up Questions

After the initial analysis, ask:

- "Which issue would give me the biggest performance improvement?"
- "Show me how to convert my batch Kalman filter to streaming mode"
- "How do I implement multi-timeframe coherence checking?"
- "What's the proper architecture for real-time WebSocket data handling?"
- "How should I structure circular buffers for each timeframe?"
- "Explain constructive interference between timeframes with an example"
