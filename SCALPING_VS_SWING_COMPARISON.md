## ⚙️ **PARAMETER COMPARISON**

### **Swing Trading (1h candles)**
```python
strategy = FourierTradingStrategy(
    n_harmonics=5,
    noise_threshold=0.3,
    base_ema_period=28,               # Longer EMA
    correlation_threshold=0.6,
    min_signal_strength=0.3,
    max_holding_periods=168,          # 7 days max
    commission=0.001
)
```

### **Scalping (5m candles)** ⚡
```python
strategy = FourierTradingStrategy(
    n_harmonics=5,
    noise_threshold=0.25,             # Less filtering → more signals
    base_ema_period=20,               # Shorter EMA → faster response
    correlation_threshold=0.55,       # Lower threshold → more trades
    min_signal_strength=0.25,         # Lower strength → more entries
    max_holding_periods=24,           # 2 hours max → quick exits
    commission=0.001
)
```

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

### **Start with Swing Trading (1h)**
Why?
1. Higher win rate (87.5%) = more confidence
2. Less screen time required
3. Better for learning
4. Lower stress
5. Still very profitable (7% in 50 days)

### **Then Add Scalping (5m)**
When?
- After 1-2 months of profitable swing trading
- When you have more time to watch charts
- When you're comfortable with the system
- When you want to increase activity

### **Or Do Both!** 🚀
- **Swing trades** on 1h for main positions
- **Scalping** on 5m for quick day trades
- Diversify your trading style
- Maximum opportunities

## 🔧 **HOW TO SWITCH BETWEEN STRATEGIES**

### **For Swing Trading (Current)**
```bash
# Use 1h data, default parameters
python visualize_fourier_trades.py
```

### **For Scalping** ⚡
```python
# In your strategy file:
from fourier_strategy import FourierTradingStrategy
from fourier_strategy.hyperliquid_adapter import HyperliquidDataAdapter

# Fetch 5m data
adapter = HyperliquidDataAdapter(symbol='ETH')
df = adapter.fetch_ohlcv(interval='5m', days_back=7)

# Use scalping parameters
strategy = FourierTradingStrategy(
    n_harmonics=5,
    noise_threshold=0.25,
    base_ema_period=20,
    correlation_threshold=0.55,
    min_signal_strength=0.25,
    max_holding_periods=24
)

results = strategy.run(df, run_backtest=True)
```

   ```

4. **Paper trade for 1-2 weeks**
