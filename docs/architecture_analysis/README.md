## üîç Key Questions the Analysis Will Answer

### Architecture
- Is your system batch-based or streaming-based?
- Are you using WebSocket or REST API?
- Can it handle real-time data?
- Is it scalable to multiple symbols?

### DSP Processing
- Are Kalman filters applied in streaming or batch mode?
- Is wavelet decomposition incremental or full-history?
- Are parameters adaptive or fixed?
- Is processing parallel or sequential?

### Signal Quality
- Are signals generated from multiple timeframes?
- Is there cross-timeframe coherence checking?
- Are confidence scores calculated?
- Is uncertainty quantified?

### Performance
- What are the computational bottlenecks?
- Is memory usage bounded?
- Are there unnecessary recomputations?
- What's the latency from data to signal?

## üõ†Ô∏è After the Analysis

### Step 1: Review the Report
- Read the executive summary
- Identify critical issues

## üí¨ Example Prompts for Claude

### After Initial Analysis
```
"Based on the analysis results, what should I implement first to get the
biggest performance improvement?"
```

### For Specific Issues
```
"The analysis says my Kalman filter is batch-processing. Can you show me
exactly how to convert it to streaming mode? Include code examples."
```

### For Implementation Help
```
"I want to implement [SPECIFIC COMPONENT]. Based on the analysis
recommendations, guide me through the implementation step-by-step."
```

### For Verification
```
"I've implemented [CHANGE]. Can you verify that it now matches the target
architecture requirements from the analysis document?"
```

## üéì Understanding the Target Architecture

The target architecture this analysis evaluates against is a **real-time, streaming DSP-based trading system** with three core components:

1. **Real-Time Data Engine**
   - WebSocket streaming (not REST polling)
   - Multi-timeframe aggregation (1m‚Üí5m‚Üí15m‚Üí1h‚Üí4h)
   - Circular buffers (bounded memory)
   - Gap handling and validation

2. **Adaptive DSP Processor**
   - Online Kalman filters (streaming, O(1) updates)
   - Streaming wavelet decomposition
   - Parallel multi-timeframe processing
   - Adaptive parameters based on volatility regime
   - Constructive interference between timeframes

3. **Signal Fusion Engine**
   - Weighted multi-timeframe signals
   - Confidence scoring with uncertainty
   - Cross-timeframe coherence validation
   - Risk-managed entry/exit triggers

**Key Principle:** Everything should be **streaming** and **incremental**, not batch-processed on historical data.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Q: The analysis is too long/detailed**
A: Ask Claude to focus on just the "Critical Issues" and "High Priority Improvements" sections first

**Q: I don't understand a technical term**
A: Ask Claude: "Can you explain [TERM] in the context of my trading system?"

**Q: The recommendations seem too complex**
A: Ask Claude: "Break down [RECOMMENDATION] into smaller, more manageable steps"

**Q: I want to validate a specific piece of code**
A: Send Claude the code and ask: "Does this match the requirements from the DSP architecture analysis?"

**Q: The analysis found nothing in my code**
A: Your codebase might not follow the expected patterns. Ask Claude: "Can you search more broadly for [COMPONENT] even if it doesn't match the exact pattern?"

---

## üìù Notes

- The analysis is based on software engineering best practices for real-time trading systems
- Recommendations prioritize performance, scalability, and correctness
- Not all improvements need to be implemented immediately - focus on critical items first
- Re-run the analysis periodically to track progress
- Use the analysis as a learning tool to understand professional trading system architecture

## üö¶ Quick Status Check

**Before you run the analysis, ask yourself:**

1. Do I understand what a "streaming" vs "batch" system means?
   - ‚úÖ Yes ‚Üí Proceed with full analysis
   - ‚ùå No ‚Üí Ask Claude to explain this first

2. Do I know if my system uses WebSocket or REST API?
   - ‚úÖ Yes ‚Üí Note this in your prompt to Claude
   - ‚ùå No ‚Üí Let the analysis discover this

3. Am I ready to make significant code changes based on findings?
   - ‚úÖ Yes ‚Üí Run comprehensive analysis
   - ‚ùå No ‚Üí Run a quick analysis for awareness first

4. Do I have time to review a detailed technical report?
   - ‚úÖ Yes (30-60 min) ‚Üí Full analysis
   - ‚ùå No (10 min) ‚Üí Ask for executive summary only
