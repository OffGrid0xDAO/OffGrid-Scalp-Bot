## 💰 POSITION SIZING EXAMPLES

| Account Size | Position (9%) | Leverage (27x) | Actual Exposure | Max Risk (1.31%) |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| $1,000 | $90 | 27x | $2,430 | $13.10 |
| $5,000 | $450 | 27x | $12,150 | $65.50 |

## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

### Phase 1: Paper Trading (1-3 days)
1. Run bot in PAPER mode on testnet
2. Verify signals match backtested behavior
3. Confirm Telegram notifications work
4. Check data fetching is reliable

### Phase 2: Live Testing (1 week)
1. Switch to LIVE mode with **small position size** ($100-$500)
2. Monitor first 5-10 trades closely
3. Compare live performance to backtest
4. Adjust if necessary

### Phase 3: Full Deployment (after 1 week)
1. If live results match backtest (±10%), scale up to target position size
2. Continue monitoring daily
3. Track actual vs backtested performance
4. Maintain risk limits

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Before Going Live
1. ✅ Test in PAPER mode first
2. ✅ Verify environment variables are set
3. ✅ Understand the leverage (27x = high exposure)
4. ✅ Start with small position size
5. ✅ Have stop-loss protection active

### Risk Warnings
- **Leverage**: 27x leverage amplifies both gains AND losses
- **Max Risk**: Each trade risks 1.31% of position (with SL)
- **Win Rate**: 75% means 1 in 4 trades will lose
- **Drawdown**: Even with 75% win rate, losing streaks can occur

### Live Trading Differences
- **Slippage**: ~0.02% (not in backtest)
- **Fees**: 0.05% per trade (not in backtest)
- **Latency**: Signal delay vs backtest
- **Liquidity**: Large orders may have worse fills

## 📊 COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS ITERATIONS

| Metric | Previous (Low Thresholds) | New Iteration 2 | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Win Rate | 52-64% | **75.0%** | +23% |
| Sharpe | 5.25-8.27 | **11.26** | +36% |
