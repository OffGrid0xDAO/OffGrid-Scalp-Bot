# Dynamic Gradient EMA Cloud - Complete Guide

## 🎨 The Concept

Instead of fixed colors, the chart now uses **DYNAMIC shading** where:

### Color = EMA Position
- **Pure GREEN (0, 255, 0)** = 100% of EMAs BELOW price (strong support)
- **Gradient** = Mix of green and red
- **Pure RED (255, 0, 0)** = 100% of EMAs ABOVE price (strong resistance)

### Opacity = EMA Compression
- **DARK (high opacity)** = EMAs tightly compressed → strong signal
- **LIGHT (low opacity)** = EMAs spread out → weak/uncertain signal

---

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. Color Calculation (Green ↔ Red Gradient)

For each timeframe cloud, we count:
```python
EMAs below price / Total EMAs = Ratio

Ratio 1.00 (100%) → RGB(0, 255, 0)     # Pure green
Ratio 0.75 (75%)  → RGB(64, 191, 0)    # Mostly green
Ratio 0.50 (50%)  → RGB(127, 127, 0)   # Equal mix (yellow-green)
Ratio 0.25 (25%)  → RGB(191, 64, 0)    # Mostly red
Ratio 0.00 (0%)   → RGB(255, 0, 0)     # Pure red
```

**Formula:**
```
Red   = 255 × (1 - ratio)
Green = 255 × ratio
Blue  = 0
```

### 2. Opacity Calculation (Compression-Based)

We measure how tightly packed the EMAs are:

```python
EMA Range = (Highest EMA - Lowest EMA)
Compression % = (EMA Range / Lowest EMA) × 100

Compression < 1%   → Opacity 0.8-0.9  # Very tight, very visible
Compression 5-10%  → Opacity 0.4-0.6  # Moderate
Compression > 20%  → Opacity 0.2-0.3  # Very spread, faint
```

**Formula:**
```
If compression_pct < 1%:    compression = 1.0
Elif compression_pct > 20%: compression = 0.0
Else:                       compression = 1.0 - ((pct - 1) / 19)

Opacity = 0.2 + (compression × 0.6)
```

### 3. Priority Boost

Timeframes **3, 5, 8, 13 min** get **30% more opacity** because they're most important for day trading.

## 🔍 Reading the Chart

### Scenario 1: Strong Bullish Trend
```
WHAT YOU SEE:
✓ Dark GREEN clouds (high opacity)
✓ All clouds stacked tightly together
✓ ⭐5min shows: 🟢 (85% tight)
✓ ⭐8min shows: 🟢 (78% tight)
✓ ⭐13min shows: 🟢 (72% tight)

INTERPRETATION:
→ EMAs highly compressed (tight range)
→ Most EMAs below price (strong support)
→ Dark green = high conviction bullish

TRADING:
→ Look for pullbacks to cloud top
→ Enter LONG when price bounces
→ High probability setup
```

### Scenario 2: Weak/Uncertain Market
```
WHAT YOU SEE:
✗ FAINT clouds (low opacity)
✗ Mix of green and red shades
✗ ⭐5min shows: 🟨 (22% tight)
✗ ⭐8min shows: 🟩 (18% tight)
✗ ⭐13min shows: 🟥 (15% tight)

INTERPRETATION:
→ EMAs spread out (wide range)
→ Mixed signals (some above, some below price)
→ Faint shading = low conviction

TRADING:
→ AVOID trading
→ Wait for compression (clouds to darken)
→ Wait for color alignment (all green or all red)
```

### Scenario 3: Bearish Reversal
```
WHAT YOU SEE:
→ Green clouds FADING (opacity decreasing)
→ Green turning to RED
→ ⭐3min: 🔴 (65% tight) - already dark red
→ ⭐5min: 🟥 (58% tight) - turning red
→ ⭐8min: 🟩 (45% tight) - still greenish but fading

INTERPRETATION:
→ Shorter TFs (3min) turning red first
→ Compression still decent (visible clouds)
→ Trend reversing from bullish to bearish

TRADING:
→ Exit LONG positions immediately
→ Wait for ⭐8min and ⭐13min to turn dark red
→ Enter SHORT when all stars aligned red + compressed
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### The Opacity (Darkness) Tells You:
1. **Dark clouds (high opacity)**
   - EMAs compressed
   - Strong consensus
   - High probability signal
   - **TRADE THIS**

2. **Faint clouds (low opacity)**
   - EMAs spread out
   - No consensus
   - Uncertain market
   - **AVOID TRADING**

### The Color Tells You:
1. **Green shades**
   - EMAs below price
   - Price using EMAs as support
   - Bullish structure
   - **LOOK FOR LONGS**

2. **Red shades**
   - EMAs above price
   - Price using EMAs as resistance
   - Bearish structure
   - **LOOK FOR SHORTS**

### The Combination:
```
BEST SETUPS:
🟢 DARK GREEN = Strong bullish + compressed → HIGH PROBABILITY LONG
🔴 DARK RED   = Strong bearish + compressed → HIGH PROBABILITY SHORT

AVOID:
🟩 FAINT GREEN = Weak bullish + spread → LOW PROBABILITY
🟥 FAINT RED   = Weak bearish + spread → LOW PROBABILITY
🟨 FAINT MIXED = No direction + spread → NO TRADE
```

## 📈 Legend Interpretation

The legend now shows **dynamic information**:

**Example:**
```
⭐5min 🟢 (78% tight)
```

Breaking it down:
- `⭐` = Priority timeframe (focus on this)
- `5min` = Timeframe duration
- `🟢` = Strong bullish (>70% EMAs below price)
- `78% tight` = High compression (EMAs packed tightly)

**Emoji Guide:**
- 🟢 = Strong Bull (>70% below price)
- 🟩 = Bullish (55-70%)
- 🟨 = Mixed (45-55%)
- 🟥 = Bearish (30-45%)
- 🔴 = Strong Bear (<30%)

**Compression Guide:**
- 80-100% tight = Very compressed (dark, strong signal)
- 50-80% tight = Moderately compressed
- 20-50% tight = Somewhat spread
- 0-20% tight = Very spread (faint, weak signal)

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Color Gradient Math

The gradient is a **linear interpolation** from red to green:

```python
def ratio_to_rgb(ratio):
    """
    ratio: 0.0 to 1.0
    0.0 = all EMAs above price (bearish)
    1.0 = all EMAs below price (bullish)
    """
    r = int(255 * (1 - ratio))  # Red decreases
    g = int(255 * ratio)         # Green increases
    b = 0                        # No blue
    return (r, g, b)
```

**Examples:**
- `ratio = 0.0` → `(255, 0, 0)` = Pure red
- `ratio = 0.25` → `(191, 64, 0)` = Dark orange-red
- `ratio = 0.5` → `(127, 127, 0)` = Yellow-orange
- `ratio = 0.75` → `(64, 191, 0)` = Yellow-green
- `ratio = 1.0` → `(0, 255, 0)` = Pure green

### Compression Calculation

```python
def calculate_compression(ema_values):
    """
    Measures how tightly packed EMAs are
    """
    ema_min = min(ema_values)
    ema_max = max(ema_values)
    ema_range = ema_max - ema_min

    # Percentage spread
    compression_pct = (ema_range / ema_min) * 100

    # Convert to 0-1 scale (inverted)
    if compression_pct < 1:
        return 1.0  # Very tight
    elif compression_pct > 20:
        return 0.0  # Very spread
    else:
        return 1.0 - ((compression_pct - 1) / 19)
```

### Dynamic Opacity

```python
def calculate_opacity(compression, is_priority_tf):
    """
    compression: 0.0 to 1.0
    is_priority_tf: True if TF is 3, 5, 8, or 13 min
    """
    # Base opacity from compression
    opacity = 0.2 + (compression * 0.6)
    # Range: 0.2 (spread) to 0.8 (compressed)

    # Boost priority timeframes
    if is_priority_tf:
        opacity = min(opacity * 1.3, 0.95)

    return opacity
```

## 🎓 Advanced Patterns

### 1. Compression Divergence
```
Price making NEW HIGHS
BUT
Cloud compression DECREASING (fading)

→ Bullish momentum weakening
→ Take profits / reduce position
→ Potential reversal coming
```

### 2. Color Cascade
```
Clouds changing color in sequence:
3min → 5min → 8min → 13min → 21min

→ Trend change propagating through timeframes
→ Early entry if first 2-3 TFs aligned
→ Confirmation when all aligned
```

### 3. Compression Breakout
```
Clouds VERY FAINT (low compression)
THEN
Suddenly become DARK (high compression)

→ Market choosing direction
→ High volatility breakout
→ Strong move coming
→ Trade in direction of color
```

### 4. Double Gradient
```
Short TFs (3,5min) = DARK GREEN
Long TFs (21,34,55min) = DARK RED

→ Short-term bullish, long-term bearish
→ Scalp opportunity (quick in/out)
→ Don't hold for swing
→ Respect longer TF bias
```

## ⚙️ Customization

### Make Clouds More Visible

Edit `src/indicators/gradient_mapper.py`:

```python
# Line ~123: Increase opacity range
opacity = 0.3 + (compression * 0.7)  # Was 0.2 + 0.6, now 0.3 + 0.7
```

### Change Compression Sensitivity

Edit `src/indicators/gradient_mapper.py`:

```python
# Line ~262: Adjust compression thresholds
if compression_pct < 2:      # Was 1, now 2 (less sensitive)
    compression = 1.0
elif compression_pct > 15:   # Was 20, now 15 (more sensitive)
    compression = 0.0
```

### Different Priority Timeframes

Edit `src/reporting/mtf_cloud_chart.py`:

```python
# Line ~126: Change which TFs get boost
if tf_minutes in [5, 8, 13, 21]:  # Was [3,5,8,13], now [5,8,13,21]
```

## 📊 Summary

### The Formula:
```
Cloud Color = f(EMAs below price / Total EMAs)
   → 100% below = Pure green (255, 0, 0)
   → 0% below = Pure red (0, 255, 0)
   → Linear gradient between

Cloud Opacity = f(EMA compression)
   → Tight EMAs (<1% range) = Dark (0.8+ opacity)
   → Spread EMAs (>20% range) = Faint (0.2 opacity)
   → Priority TFs get 30% boost
```

### Trading Rules:
```
TRADE when:
  ✓ DARK clouds (high compression)
  ✓ ALIGNED colors (all green or all red)
  ✓ ⭐ Priority TFs agree

AVOID when:
  ✗ FAINT clouds (low compression)
  ✗ MIXED colors (green + red)
  ✗ ⭐ Priority TFs disagree
```
