Tighter stop loss helps maintain profit factor while taking more trades."

Remove 'low' volume to focus on the 76.7% of profitable missed trades with normal+ volume. Implement tiered take-profit levels (25% at each level) instead of single exits to reduce the 1.45% avg left on table. Set stop-loss at 3.5% to maintain reasonable risk management while allowing for normal volatility."
