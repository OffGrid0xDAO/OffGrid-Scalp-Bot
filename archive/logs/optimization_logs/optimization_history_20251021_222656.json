Added 'low' volume condition since 17.3% high volume in missed trades suggests volume filtering is too restrictive. Implemented tiered take profits (25%, 25%, 25%, 25% position sizing) with higher targets to reduce early exits and capture more of the 1.96% average left on table. Tighter stop loss (4.5%) to maintain risk control while taking more trades."
