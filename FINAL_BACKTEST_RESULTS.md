# ‚úÖ FINAL BACKTEST RESULTS - 5M SCALPING WITH 25X LEVERAGE

## üêõ ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED

**The Bug:** Entry and exit were happening on the SAME candle!

**Root Cause:**
```python
# We were entering at the CLOSE price of candle i
entry_price = current_price  # close of candle i

# But then checking TP/SL against HIGH/LOW of candle i+1
# If the high/low of candle i+1 ALREADY touched TP/SL, we exited IMMEDIATELY!

# Even worse: if holding_periods == 0 (same candle), we didn't skip the check
```

**Example of the bug:**
1. Enter LONG at $4000 (close of candle 100)
2. TP set to $4060 (1.5% above entry)
3. Next candle 101 has high of $4070
4. TP check: $4070 >= $4060 ‚Üí EXIT immediately!
5. holding_periods = 1, but we already exited

**The Fix:**
```python
if holding_periods == 0:
    # Skip ALL exit checks on entry candle
    should_exit = False
else:
    # Check TP/SL using high/low...
```

Now trades MUST be held for at least 1 candle (5 minutes) before ANY exit check!

## üí∞ POSITION SIZING & RISK ANALYSIS (25x Leverage)

### Current Settings (SAFE ‚úÖ)
```
Capital:              $1000
Position Size:        10% = $100 margin
Leverage:             25x
Position Value:       $100 √ó 25 = $2500
Stop Loss:            0.9% of price
Max Loss per Trade:   $2500 √ó 0.009 = $22.50
Risk as % of Capital: $22.50 / $1000 = 2.25% ‚úÖ
```

### Safety Analysis
```
Max Risk Allowed:     5% of capital = $50
Actual Risk:          2.25% = $22.50 ‚úÖ
Safety Margin:        2.75% ($27.50) ‚úÖ
Liquidation Distance: 4% (25x leverage)
Stop Loss Distance:   0.9%
Safety Buffer:        3.1% before liquidation ‚úÖ
```

**Verdict: VERY SAFE!**
- Risk per trade (2.25%) is **LESS THAN HALF** the 5% limit
- Plenty of room before liquidation (3.1% buffer)
- Conservative position sizing

### If You Want Higher Returns:
```
To use full 5% risk allowance:
- Max Position Size: 22.2% of capital
- This would give: 0.222 √ó 25 √ó 0.009 = 5% risk per trade
- But 10% is SAFER for starting out!
```

## üéØ EXPECTED LIVE PERFORMANCE

Based on 17-day backtest:

**Iteration 6 (Recommended):**
```

**Risk Management:**
- If 2 consecutive SL hits: reduce position size to 8%
- If 3 losing days in a row: switch to lower iteration (4‚Üí3‚Üí2‚Üí1)
- If drawdown > 10%: pause trading and review
- If liquidation distance < 2%: immediately close position
