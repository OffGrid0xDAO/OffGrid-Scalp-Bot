      "Finding 1: CATASTROPHIC MISS RATE - We have 0% catch rate on 40 big movements averaging 0.70% each (28% total missed profit). The data shows clear early warning signals 4.5 minutes before peaks with average 25.8 light EMAs, but our threshold is only 3 - we're missing every single big opportunity.",
      "Finding 2: BIG MOVEMENT PATTERN IDENTIFIED - Big movements consistently show 25.8 light EMAs appearing 4.5 minutes before peak, with optimal entry at 2.5 minutes before peak. Current rules are completely misaligned for these high-value opportunities.",
      "Finding 3: TRANSITION SPEED MISMATCH - Big movements strongly favor slow transitions (35 vs 5 fast) and stable/expanding compression (38 vs 2 compressing). Our current filters may be blocking these optimal big movement patterns.",
      "Finding 4: ZERO EXECUTION DESPITE OPPORTUNITIES - No actual trades executed suggests rules are over-conservative. We need aggressive big movement detection that overrides normal safety filters when clear momentum surge patterns appear.",
      "Finding 5: WINNING PATTERNS SHOW PROMISE - 60% win rate on ribbon flips with 0.09% avg winners vs -0.06% avg losers indicates good base strategy, but we need to scale up to catch the big movements that drive real profits."

    "reasoning": "The data reveals a critical optimization failure - we're missing 100% of big movements worth ~28% profit due to severely misaligned detection thresholds. The solution requires aggressive action: implement dedicated Path F momentum surge detection using the 25.8 light EMA threshold from big movement analysis, with complete override authority over normal filters. I'm lowering normal barriers (alignment to 0.4, light EMAs to 2, extending hold time to 30min) to enable regular trading while Path F handles big movements. The 4.5-minute early warning window and 2.5-minute optimal entry timing provide clear implementation targets. Volume surge detection and momentum expansion filters will catch the patterns that preceded big movements. This dual-track approach maintains safety for normal trades while ensuring we capture every big movement opportunity going forward.",
