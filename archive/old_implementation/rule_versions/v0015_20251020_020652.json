      "Finding 1: CRITICAL EXECUTION FAILURE - Zero trades executed despite 40 big movements averaging 0.70% profit. Current filters are blocking ALL entries, including the most profitable opportunities worth potentially 28% cumulative profit.",

      "Finding 3: PERFECT TIMING ADVANTAGE UNUSED - We have 4.5-minute early warning with optimal 2.5-minute entry timing before peaks, but zero execution means this massive edge is completely wasted.",
      "Finding 4: STABLE-EXPANSION PATTERN DOMINANCE - 50% of big movements occur during stable compression transitioning to expansion, while only 12.5% are fast transitions. Our current rules don't detect this critical pattern.",

    "reasoning": "The data reveals a catastrophic system failure: we're missing 100% of the most profitable opportunities (40 big movements worth 0.70% each) due to overly restrictive filters. The solution is revolutionary: implement a dual-track system where Path F Momentum Surge gets absolute priority with complete filter override when 25+ light EMAs appear. I'm loosening all restrictive parameters (alignment to 0.03, extending windows to 60 minutes) to enable basic execution while the momentum surge system handles the big profits. The 4.5-minute early warning with optimal 2.5-minute entry timing gives us massive edge if we can execute. Volume confirmation prevents false signals. The 77.5% upward bias means prioritizing longs during surges. This transforms us from a zero-execution system into a momentum-detection machine that prioritizes the highest-value trades first.",
