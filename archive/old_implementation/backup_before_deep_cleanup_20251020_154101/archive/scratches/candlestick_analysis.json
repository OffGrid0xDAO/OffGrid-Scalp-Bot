  "overall_assessment": "Market is in a clear bearish phase with both timeframes confirming the downtrend. The 5-minute ribbon has flipped to all_red while the 15-minute is transitioning bearish, indicating strong selling pressure. Key resistance at 3890-3892 has held multiple times, and the break below 3888 support suggests further downside. The failed breakout above 3910 on the 15-minute and subsequent lower highs pattern confirms distribution. Risk/reward favors short positions with tight stops above 3896. Next major support targets are 3880 and potentially 3870-3875. Any bounces should be viewed as selling opportunities until price can reclaim 3896+ with conviction.",
