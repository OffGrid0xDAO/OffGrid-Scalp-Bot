      "Finding 1: MASSIVE BIG MOVEMENT OPPORTUNITY LOSS - 40 big movements averaging 0.70% were completely missed because our min_light_emas_required is only 2, while big movements show 25.8 light EMAs on average. This represents approximately 28% profit potential lost.",
      "Finding 2: PERFECT EARLY WARNING SYSTEM AVAILABLE - Big movements provide 4.5-minute early warning signals with optimal entry timing at 2.5 minutes before peak. We have a massive timing advantage we're not exploiting.",
      "Finding 3: EXECUTION CRISIS - Despite having 1 ribbon flip that generated a setup, we executed 0 actual trades, indicating our filters are blocking profitable entries. The system is too restrictive.",
      "Finding 4: STABLE-TO-EXPANSION PATTERN DOMINANCE - 50% of big movements occur during stable compression that then expands, while only 12.5% are fast transitions. We should prioritize stability over speed.",
      "Finding 5: SINGLE TRADE VALIDATION - Our 1 losing trade (-0.07%) in all_red state shows we need better directional filtering, but the overall low loss validates our risk management works."

      "Add EMA spread expansion detection to catch the compression-to-expansion pattern that precedes 50% of big movements",
      "Implement dual profit target system: 0.7% for momentum surge trades, 0.5% for normal trades to match actual movement magnitudes",

    "reasoning": "The data reveals a critical gap: we have a working system (low loss rate validates risk management) but we're missing the most profitable opportunities. The 40 big movements averaging 0.70% with 25.8 light EMAs show we need a revolutionary dual-track approach. Path F Momentum Surge gets absolute priority with complete filter override authority to catch every big movement. I'm slightly tightening normal filters (alignment to 0.12, min light EMAs to 3) to improve quality while loosening execution constraints (45min hold, 25min fresh window) to enable more trades. The 4.5-minute early warning system with volume confirmation ensures we never miss another 0.7% movement. This transforms us from missing 28% of profit opportunities into a big-movement detection machine.",
