Adding 'low' volume allows entry during accumulation phases where 17.6% of missed profits occurred. Staged profit-taking at 0.8%, 1.5%, 2.5%, and 4.0% addresses the early exit problem by keeping partial positions for larger moves, while the 1.2% stop loss maintains reasonable risk control. This should capture more of the 182 missed trades while reducing the 0.93% average left on the table from early exits."
