## üîß SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- `hyperliquid-python-sdk` - Hyperliquid API
- `eth-account` - Ethereum wallet
- `websockets` - WebSocket streaming
- `numpy`, `pandas` - Data processing
- `python-telegram-bot` - Telegram notifications
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variables

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Hyperliquid (REQUIRED)
HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here_without_0x

# Telegram (OPTIONAL but recommended)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id

# Anthropic (if using AI optimization)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING:**
- NEVER commit `.env` to git
- Keep your private key secure
- Use a dedicated trading wallet (not your main wallet)

### Step 3: Adjust Configuration (Optional)

Edit `config_live.json` to adjust parameters:

```json
{
  "symbol": "ETH",
  "initial_capital": 10000.0,     // Adjust to your actual capital
  "max_position_size": 0.3,       // 30% per trade
  "max_daily_loss": 0.05,         // 5% daily loss limit
  "max_drawdown": 0.15,           // 15% max drawdown
  "enable_telegram": true
}
```

### Step 4: Test Connection

First, test your Hyperliquid API connection:

```bash
python src/exchange/hyperliquid_client.py
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Using Hyperliquid MAINNET
‚úÖ Hyperliquid client initialized for address: 0x1234...5678
‚úÖ Account balance: $1000.00
‚úÖ All tests passed!
```

### Step 5: Start Trading Bot

**Interactive mode (recommended for first time):**
```bash
python start_manifest.py
```

This will:
- Check environment variables
- Show configuration
- Ask for confirmation before starting
- Start live trading after you type "YES"

**Direct start (skip confirmation):**
```bash
python start_manifest.py --live
```

**Custom configuration:**
```bash
python start_manifest.py --config my_config.json
```

**Override capital:**
```bash
python start_manifest.py --capital 5000
```

tail -f trading_bot_*.log
```

### State File

Bot state is saved to `trading_state.json`:
- Current capital

This allows the bot to recover after restarts.

---

## üéØ WHAT THE BOT DOES

### Signal Generation

1. **Real-time data**: WebSocket stream from Hyperliquid
2. **Multi-timeframe analysis**: 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h
3. **FFT signal processing**: Fourier analysis removes noise
4. **Adaptive Kalman filter**: Predicts price movements
5. **Signal fusion**: Combines signals across timeframes
6. **Constructive interference**: Higher timeframes modulate lower

### Trade Execution

When ALL conditions are met:
- High confidence (‚â•65%)
- High coherence (‚â•60%)
- Multiple timeframes agree
- Within risk limits

The bot will:
1. Calculate position size (max 30% of capital)
2. Execute market order
3. Set automatic stop loss
4. Set automatic take profit
5. Monitor position continuously

### Risk Management

**Automatic protections:**
- Max 3 concurrent positions
- Daily loss limit: 5% ‚Üí stops trading for 24h
- Max drawdown: 15% ‚Üí stops all trading
- Position size limit: 30% of capital
- Automatic stop losses on all trades

---

## üõë STOPPING THE BOT

### Graceful Shutdown

Press `Ctrl+C` once:
```
^C
‚ö†Ô∏è  Received shutdown signal
üõë Shutting down gracefully...
```

The bot will:
1. Stop accepting new signals
2. Close WebSocket connection
3. Close all open positions
4. Save final state
5. Send Telegram notification

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT force kill (Ctrl+C twice) - this may leave positions open!**

### Emergency Stop

If the bot is unresponsive:

1. Log into Hyperliquid manually: https://app.hyperliquid.xyz
2. Close all positions manually
3. Then kill the bot process

| Max Drawdown | -0.01% (very low risk) |
| Profit Factor | 96.37 (unprecedented) |

## üí∞ RECOMMENDED CAPITAL ALLOCATION

### Conservative (Recommended for beginners)

- **Starting capital**: $500-$1,000

- **Max daily loss**: 3% ($15-$30)
- **Expected monthly return**: 3-5%

### Moderate

- **Starting capital**: $2,000-$5,000
- **Max position size**: 30% ($600-$1,500 per trade)
- **Max daily loss**: 5% ($100-$250)
- **Expected monthly return**: 5-8%

### Aggressive (Only if experienced)

- **Starting capital**: $10,000+
- **Max position size**: 30% ($3,000+ per trade)
- **Max daily loss**: 5% ($500+)
- **Expected monthly return**: 8-15%

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER trade with money you can't afford to lose completely!**

---

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### "HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY not set"

**Fix**: Add your private key to `.env` file (without 0x prefix)

```env
HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY=1234567890abcdef...
```

### "WebSocket connection failed"

**Possible causes:**
- Internet connection issue
- Hyperliquid API down
- Firewall blocking WebSocket

**Fix**: Check internet connection, try again in a few minutes

### "Order rejected: Max concurrent positions reached"

**Explanation**: You already have 3 open positions (the maximum)

**Fix**: Wait for a position to close, or increase `max_concurrent_positions` in config

### "Daily loss limit reached"

**Explanation**: Bot lost 5% today and stopped trading

**Fix**: Wait until next day (resets at midnight UTC), or accept the loss and restart carefully

### "High latency: XXms"

**Explanation**: Pipeline processing is slow (target: <100ms)

**Possible causes:**
- Slow internet
- CPU overload
- Too many timeframes

**Fix**:
- Use faster internet
- Close other programs
- Reduce timeframes in config

---

## üö® WHEN TO STOP THE BOT

Stop immediately if:

- ‚ùå Abnormal losses (>10% in a day)
- ‚ùå Bot behaving erratically
- ‚ùå Multiple failed trades in a row
- ‚ùå You feel uncomfortable with the risk
- ‚ùå Market conditions drastically change
- ‚ùå Major news events

**Trust your instincts - if something feels wrong, STOP!**
