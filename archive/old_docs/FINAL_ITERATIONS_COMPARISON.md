## 🎯 ITERATION CHANGES

### **Baseline** (Original MTF Strategy)
- Confluence gap: 10
- Confluence min: 20
- RSI-7: [25, 50]
- Volume ratio: 1.0
- Stoch D: 35
- Quality: 50
- Ribbon flip: NOT required
- TP: 2%, SL: 1.5%, Trailing: 0.8%, Hold: 24h

### **Iteration 1** ❌ FAILED
**Changes**:
- REQUIRED ribbon flip (75% threshold)
- Relaxed ALL filters heavily
- TP: 3%, Trailing: 1.2%, Hold: 48h

**Result**: -0.14% return, 50% win rate
**Problem**: Ribbon flip requirement was too restrictive, caught early/false signals

### **Iteration 2** ✅ GOOD
**Changes**:
- Made ribbon flip OPTIONAL (not required)
- Slightly relaxed filters: gap=8, min=18, ratio=0.9, stoch=32, quality=45
- TP: 2.5%, Trailing: dynamic (0.8→1.2→1.8%), Hold: 36h

**Result**: +1.14% return, 53.3% win rate
**Good**: Got trades back, profit recovered

### **Iteration 3** 🏆 WINNER
**Changes** (vs Iteration 2):
- Tightened filters back: gap=10, min=20, ratio=1.0, stoch=35, quality=50
- Kept dynamic trailing stop
- Same exit parameters as Iter2

**Result**: +1.40% return, 57.1% win rate, 2.83 profit factor
**Perfect**: Better than baseline!

## ⚠️ REMAINING ISSUES

### 1. **Win Rate Still Lower** (57% vs 83%)
- Baseline had 6 trades, 5 winners = lucky?
- Iteration 3 has 14 trades, more realistic sample size
- 57% win rate is actually HEALTHY for day trading

### 2. **Some Trailing Stop Exits**
- 4 trades (28.6%) exited on trailing
- Some left profit on table
- Trade-off: dynamic trailing protects downside

### 3. **4 Stop Losses** (28.6%)
- 4 trades hit stop loss
- Average loss: -1.27%
- Acceptable for active strategy

## 🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Use Iteration 3 Parameters**:
```json
{
  "confluence_gap_min": 10,
  "confluence_score_min": 20,
  "rsi_7_range": [20, 55],
  "min_volume_ratio": 1.0,
