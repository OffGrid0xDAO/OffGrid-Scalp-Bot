## 🎯 STRATEGY STRENGTHS

## ⚠️ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

### 1. **Trade Frequency (1.4/week)**
**Issue**: Only 6 trades in 30 days
- 2 weeks with NO trades
- Might be over-filtering

**Potential Solutions**:
- Loosen MTF requirements slightly
- Add alternative entry setups
- Use tiered approach (MTF + non-MTF)

### 2. **Trailing Stop Exit (Trade #1)**
**Issue**: Exited at +0.29% when peak was +1.22%
- Left 1% on the table
- Trailing too tight?

**Potential Solutions**:
- Widen trailing stop distance
- Use time-based trailing (after X hours)
- Keep riding winners longer

### 3. **Limited Long Trades (1/6)**
**Issue**: Only 1 long trade vs 5 short trades
- Might be missing long opportunities
- Strategy bias toward shorts?

**Potential Solutions**:
- Review MTF confirmation for longs
- Check if filters are asymmetric
- Add more training data for longs
