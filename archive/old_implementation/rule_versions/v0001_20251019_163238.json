    "key_findings": [
      "Finding 1: Low win rate (25%) indicates current entry criteria may be capturing false signals or entering too early in pattern development",
      "Finding 2: Winners significantly outperform losers (0.24% vs -0.07%) suggesting good risk-reward when trades work, but need better entry timing",
      "Finding 3: Winning pattern shows strong ribbon alignment (61.5% green EMAs, 16 light green EMAs) indicating higher alignment threshold may improve quality",
      "Finding 4: Losing patterns show weaker alignment (43.6% green, 11.3 light green) and include mixed_red states, suggesting current filters are insufficient",
      "Finding 5: Zero actual trades executed suggests rules are now too restrictive after previous optimization, preventing data collection"
    ],
    "pattern_recommendations": [
      "Increase ribbon alignment threshold to 0.80+ to filter out the weaker 43.6% alignment patterns that are losing",
      "Require minimum 12-15 light EMAs in direction to match winning pattern characteristics (16 avg vs 11.3 losing avg)",
      "Temporarily disable mixed_red state entries as 2 of 3 losing trades came from this pattern",
      "Focus on mixed_green and all_green states which showed the winning pattern",
      "Add minimum ribbon strength filter requiring >60% EMAs in trade direction"

    },
    "reasoning": "The data clearly shows winning trades have much stronger ribbon alignment (61.5% vs 43.6% green EMAs) and more light EMAs (16 vs 11.3). Increasing alignment threshold to 0.80 and requiring 12+ light EMAs should filter out the weaker patterns causing losses. Reducing profit target to 0.003% and stop to 0.002% maintains the favorable 1.5:1 reward-risk ratio while being more realistic for scalping. Shorter 15-minute hold time prevents trades from deteriorating. Prioritizing wick reversal patterns first as they typically offer clearest entry signals with defined risk levels."
