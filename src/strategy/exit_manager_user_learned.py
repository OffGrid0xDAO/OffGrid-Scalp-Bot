Exit Manager - ML-LEARNED from User's Actual Exits
Based on analysis of 22 user trades with 90.9% WR and +4.86% return

Key Learnings:
- TP at 2.51% (median of 17 TP exits)
- SL at 0.60% (median of 2 losses)
- Trailing width: 0.92% (median giveback on trailing wins)
- Profit lock: 0.69% (prevent reversals like Trade #8, #18)
