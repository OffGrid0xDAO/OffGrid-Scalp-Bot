## 🎯 Scalper Score System

Every learning cycle is graded on a **0-100 scale** measuring true scalping effectiveness:

### Score Components:

**1. Win Rate (0-40 points)**
- Target: 20%+ win rate
- 20% = 40 points (full)
- 10% = 20 points
- 5% = 10 points

**2. Speed (0-20 points)**
- Target: 10-20 minute holds (quick in/out)
- 10-20 min = 20 points (perfect scalper timing)
- 5-25 min = 15 points (acceptable)
- <5 or >25 min = 10 points (too fast or too slow)

**3. Risk Management (0-20 points)**
- Target: R:R ratio ≥2:1
- ≥2:1 = 20 points (excellent)
- ≥1.5:1 = 15 points (good)
- ≥1:1 = 10 points (acceptable)
- <1:1 = 5 points (poor)

**4. Consistency (0-20 points)**
- Target: Max loss <0.15%
- <0.15% = 20 points (excellent risk control)
- <0.30% = 15 points (good)
- <0.50% = 10 points (acceptable)
- ≥0.50% = 5 points (poor)

### Grade Scale:

```
90-100: A+ (Elite Scalper) 🏆
80-89:  A  (Excellent Scalper) ⭐
70-79:  B  (Good Scalper) ✅
60-69:  C  (Improving) 📈
50-59:  D  (Needs Work) ⚠️
0-49:   F  (High Risk) 🚨
```
