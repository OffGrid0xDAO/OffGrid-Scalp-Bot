        "reasoning": "The current confluence_gap_min (30) is too restrictive given missed trades averaged 28.4. Lowering both confluence parameters to 25 should capture more profitable setups. Adding 'normal' volume allows entry on 20.8% more opportunities where high volume wasn't present but trades were still profitable. The tiered take-profit system (25% at 0.8%, 50% at 1.5%, 25% at 2.5%) addresses early exits by letting portions run longer while securing some gains. The 1.2% stop loss balances the max drawdown risk with the improved profit targets."
