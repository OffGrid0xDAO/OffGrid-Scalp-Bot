# OPTIMAL TRADING STRATEGY - Data-Driven & Regime-Adaptive

## üö® CRITICAL INSIGHT: REGIME-ADAPTIVE STRATEGY

**THE STRATEGY CHANGES COMPLETELY BASED ON MARKET REGIME!**

### KEY PRINCIPLE (FROM REAL TRADING DATA):

**BULLISH REGIME:**
- When market is trending UP, wicks DOWN below all EMAs = PERFECT LONG entry
- This is whales/smart money grabbing liquidity (stop hunting) before continuing up
- Price recovers FAST ‚Üí Great scalping opportunity
- **AVOID SHORT in bullish** (counter-trend = low win rate)

**BEARISH REGIME:**
- When market is trending DOWN, wicks UP above all EMAs = PERFECT SHORT entry
- This is whales grabbing liquidity (stop hunting) before continuing down
- Price reverses FAST ‚Üí Great scalping opportunity
- **AVOID LONG in bearish** (counter-trend = low win rate)

**RANGING REGIME:**
- Both directions can work (mean reversion)
- BUT: Win rates typically lower
- Reduce position size or wait for clear trend

**ONCE TENDENCY CHANGES, THE STRATEGY CHANGES!** ‚Üê Monitor regime constantly

## üìä YOUR DATA - MARKET REGIME PERFORMANCE


### RANGING_QUIET:
- LONG wick win rate: 5.1% (39 samples)
- SHORT wick win rate: 3.1% (163 samples)
- **STRATEGY: CAUTION: Low win rates in ranging market. LONG: 5.1%, SHORT: 3.1%. Reduce size or skip until clear trend emerges.**

### BULLISH_TRENDING:
- LONG wick win rate: 0.0% (0 samples)
- SHORT wick win rate: 0.0% (2 samples)
- **STRATEGY: NO DATA: No LONG wick samples in BULLISH regime. Monitor and take first clear wick down opportunity.**

## üïØÔ∏è  WICK-BASED ENTRIES (HIGHEST PRIORITY!)

**Wick detection is your BEST edge:**


## ‚è±Ô∏è  OPTIMAL HOLD TIMES

Based on backtest analysis:

- **5min**: 0.0% WR | Avg P&L: -0.001%
- **10min**: 0.5% WR | Avg P&L: -0.018%
- **15min**: 0.5% WR | Avg P&L: -0.027%
- **20min**: 1.5% WR | Avg P&L: -0.023%

**RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME: 20min** (highest win rate: 1.5%)

## üìà EMA STATE RULES


## üéØ ENTRY CHECKLIST

**Before entering ANY trade:**

1. ‚úÖ Identify current market regime (bullish/bearish/ranging)
2. ‚úÖ Check for wick signal (0.3-0.8% outside ribbon)
3. ‚úÖ Confirm wick direction matches regime strategy
4. ‚úÖ Verify EMA state aligns with direction
5. ‚úÖ Ensure timeframes agree (5min + 15min)
6. ‚úÖ Plan to hold 20min (don't exit early!)

## üö´ AVOID THESE MISTAKES

‚ùå Entering without wick signal in trending markets
‚ùå Going LONG in bearish regime (or SHORT in bullish)
‚ùå Exiting before 20min unless TP/SL hit
‚ùå Trading with conflicting timeframes
‚ùå Ignoring market regime changes

## üí∞ RISK MANAGEMENT

- **Take Profit:** 1.5% minimum
- **Stop Loss:** 0.8-1.0% (based on volatility)
- **Hold Duration:** 20min target
- **Position Size:** Conservative until 60%+ WR proven
