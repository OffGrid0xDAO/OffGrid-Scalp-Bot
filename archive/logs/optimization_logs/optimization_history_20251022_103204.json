Implementing trailing stops starting at 1.2% profit helps hold winners longer while protecting gains. The flexible VWAP mode allows some discretion around institutional levels rather than strict requirements."

Reducing quality score from 56 to 48 should increase trade frequency significantly. The key insight is that you're leaving 1.12% avg on the table per early exit - implementing a trailing stop system with partial profit-taking at 1.5%, 3.0%, and 5.0% levels, plus trailing stops after 2% gains, should help ride winners longer while protecting profits. Relaxing volume and RSI requirements slightly will help capture the 19.6% high volume trades you're missing."

For exits: implementing trailing stops and wider profit targets to address the 1.12% average left on table from 77 early exits. This should improve trade capture rate while maintaining quality through VWAP, Bollinger, and Stochastic filters."
