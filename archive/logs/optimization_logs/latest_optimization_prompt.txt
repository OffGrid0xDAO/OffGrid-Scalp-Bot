## Question

Based on this data, what parameter adjustments would you suggest to:
1. Capture more of the missed profitable trades
2. Reduce early exits (hold winners longer)
3. Improve overall win rate and profit factor

Please provide specific numerical suggestions in this JSON format:

```json

    "volume_requirement": [<list of strings>],
    "take_profit_levels": [<list of numbers>],
    "stop_loss_pct": <number>
  },
