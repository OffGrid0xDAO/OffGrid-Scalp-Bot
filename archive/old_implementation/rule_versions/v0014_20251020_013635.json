      "Finding 1: MASSIVE OPPORTUNITY LOSS - 40 big movements averaging 0.70% were completely missed because our min_light_emas_required is only 2, while big movements consistently show 25.8 light EMAs. This represents potentially 28% profit missed (40 \u00d7 0.70%).",
      "Finding 2: PERFECT EARLY WARNING SYSTEM EXISTS - Big movements provide 4.5-minute advance warning with optimal entry timing at 2.5 minutes before peak. We have a massive timing advantage but zero execution.",
      "Finding 3: STABLE-TO-EXPANSION DOMINANCE - 50% of big movements occur during stable compression that transitions to expansion, while only 12.5% are fast transitions. Our current rules favor speed over stability detection.",
      "Finding 4: ZERO EXECUTION BOTTLENECK - Despite having optimal setups available, 0 trades executed indicates our filters are blocking ALL profitable entries, including the big movements.",
      "Finding 5: UPWARD BIAS OPPORTUNITY - 77.5% of big movements are upward (31 up vs 9 down), suggesting we should prioritize long setups when momentum surge patterns appear."

      "Add EMA spread expansion detection to catch the stable-to-expansion pattern that precedes 50% of big movements",

    "reasoning": "The data reveals a catastrophic missed opportunity: 40 big movements averaging 0.70% profit were completely ignored due to overly restrictive filters. The key insight is that big movements have a distinct signature (25.8 light EMAs) that's completely different from our current threshold of 2. I'm implementing a revolutionary dual-track system: Path F Momentum Surge gets absolute priority with complete filter override to catch every big movement, while loosening normal filters (alignment to 0.05, 45min windows) to enable basic execution. The 4.5-minute early warning with 2.5-minute optimal entry gives us a massive edge. Volume confirmation prevents false signals. The 77.5% upward bias suggests prioritizing longs during momentum surges. This transforms us from missing 100% of the most profitable opportunities into a momentum-detection machine that prioritizes the highest-value trades first.",
