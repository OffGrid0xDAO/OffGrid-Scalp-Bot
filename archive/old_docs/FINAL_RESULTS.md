## üìà ITERATION JOURNEY

### Version 1: OLD Strategy (Conservative)
- **Problem**: Too restrictive, missing opportunities
- Confluence gap >30, MACD required, perfect indicators needed
- Result: Only 9 trades, 33.3% win rate

### Version 2: NEW Strategy (Liberal - Initial Pattern Match)
- **Problem**: Too permissive, massive over-trading
- Removed most filters to match user's "loose" patterns
- Result: 241 trades (11x too many!), 81.3% false positive rate

### Version 3: REFINED Strategy (Goldilocks - Final)
- **Solution**: Added discriminator filters from overlap analysis
- Kept user's flexible approach BUT added quality gates
- Result: 13 trades (close to user's 22), 53.8% win rate, PROFITABLE!

4. **Stochastic D Confirmation**: Higher Stoch D (avg 50.8) indicates quality
5. **Confluence Flexibility**: You trade with low confluence (avg 30-32)
6. **Direction Agnostic**: Take both longs and shorts equally
7. **Quality Over Quantity**: Wait for setups with multiple confirmations
